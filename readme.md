This repository is the RapidPatch Runtime which is an independent library. You can easily port this library into to different RTOS or bare-metal firmware and integrate them into the existing code via CMake or Makefile.     

If you want to run the firmware used in our paper, please use the demo projects in the RapidPatch/VulDevices Repository.
